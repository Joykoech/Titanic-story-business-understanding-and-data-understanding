Titanic StoryÂ¶

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class passengers.

#DATA UNDERSTANDING

The data understanding phase starts with an initial data collection and proceeds with activities in order to get familiar with the data, to identify data quality problems, to discover first insights into the data, or to detect interesting subsets to form hypotheses for hidden information. This step is often mixed with the next step, Data Preparation


#DATA UNDERSTANDING PROCESS

The first process is importing the necessary libraries which are pandas for data manupilation,matplotlib and seaborn for visualisation
The next step is checking the data quality which includes perfoming Explaratory Data Analysis(EDA). This is simply checking for the missing values in the data,checking the descriptive statistics of the data i.e checking for the mean,standard deviation,median,the percentiles and performing the necessary visualisations.
The last part of this project included answering the analytical questions pertaining the data
